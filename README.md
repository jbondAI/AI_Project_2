 # EXAMINATION OF VEHICLE EMISSIONS AND IMPACT ON CLIMATE (Project 2)

This repository, developed to share documentation and code related to UNCC/UNC Chapel Hill AI Bootcamp Project 2 (Group 4), contains the source data, approach, algorithms and key findings related to an examination of the climate impact of individual and market adoption of light-weight electric vehicles.

## PROJECT OBJECTIVE
To examine the climate impact of individual and market adoption of light-weight electric vehicles through exploration of vehicle lifecycle emissions, light-duty vehicle sale trends, vehicle stock and EV adoption outlook, projected vehicle efficiency changes, key climate policies and current climate science. 

## APPROACH

__Data Acquisition and Preparation__ 
* **DATASETS:** Datasets examined and explored in our modeling and analysis are compiled in the _Resources_folder amd read in to the **_project_datasets.ipynb_** file along with additional data read in from html.
*
* **DATA DOCUMENTATION:** Details about each dataset, including source and links to documentation, are available within the _project_datasets_ notebook. 

* **USING DATASETS:** All datasets used in our modling and analysis are described in the _project_datasets_ notebook which may be run directly or via running the
